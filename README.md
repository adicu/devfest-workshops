# devfest-workshops

The goal of this hackathon workshop series is to help people go from coding in the classroom to building a real-world hackathon app -- all within the span of 5 days. For those with more experience, we provide the chance to build on a choose-your-own-adventure scaffolding, as well as a community of supportive hackers.
