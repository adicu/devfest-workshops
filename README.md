# devfest-workshops

Point A: you've just finished your intro Python class, but you're wondering how people create all these cool hackathon projects. 

Point B: you're the one building hackathon projects and bringing your dreams to life. 

The goal of this hackathon bootcamp series is to get participants from point A to point B!

## Structure

Devfest is taking place the last week of January. The week before Devfest will be filled with two kinds of events: **evangelizing discussions** and **fill-in-the-blank work sessions**. (Names subject to change)

**Evangelizing discussions:** We noticed that the best workshops we've been to didn't involve any coding. Instead, they are what we might call evangelical discussions, which are more focused on promoting the design and philosophy of a technique as opposed to the implementation details. That said, they are often quite practical. Some good talks of this form might be "10 things I learned from 10 years of React development" or "A job whale done: How Docker can streamline your environment setup and simplify your deployment."

**Fill-in-the-blank work sessions:** Think about the most fun p-sets you've done for a coding class. You're probably imaging some version of a fill-in-the-blank exercise, where the instructor has already completed the scaffolding for you, and your job is to fill in the missing sections of code. Along with the scaffolding you're given some unit tests. Once you pass all the unit tests, you'll get to see satisfying green checkmarks and have a working program!

For our hackathon bootcamp, we will create one of these gamified sample projects, which will have modules teaching you all the important skills -- frontend, backend, databases, design, etc. During the Devfest week, we will conquer a room for 2 hours a day and use it for working through the fill-in-the-blank projects. We will have experienced hackers around the room to help with technical issues (or just to chat!). Think of it as a group coloring session, except we are coding instead of coloring! The modules of this sample app will be relatively independent, so that you can choose your own adventure and add new features as you please. 

We imagine that many people might take their bootcamp project, add a new feature, and submit it for the hackathon. This is great! That means they've learned the skills they need to work on a hackathon-style project and are one step closer to bringing their future dreams to life. 

## Project Timeline

Making a gamified coding coloring book is a substantial project. As a result, I think we should spend the entire semester preparing this material. Here's a rough timeline:

- September 20: decide on a sample app as the overarching project
- September-October: finish an initial version of a single module, complete with unit tests and tutorials. Beta test it.
- October-November: Split into small teams to develop more modules, using the initial one as a template. 
- November-December: Add gamification and make improvements to the existing modules.

This is a tight timeline, especially around October-November. We probably want a team of 5-7 people to do this, each spending ~3-5 hrs a week on average. 

For specific tasks, we will be using the following Jira board: <JIRA LINK WILL GO HERE>
