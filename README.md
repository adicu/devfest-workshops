# devfest-workshops

Imagine you've just finished your intro Python class. Suddenly, you wonder: what's next? How are people building all these cool projects, when all I've done is print to the terminal? Though you feel a bit intimidated, you realize you want to build things -- you want to bring your dreams to life!

The goal of this hackathon bootcamp series is to help people go from coding in the classroom to building a real-world hackathon app -- all within the span of 5 days. For those with more experience, we provide the chance to build on a gamified choose-your-own-adventure scaffolding, as well as a community of supportive hackers. 

## Structure

Devfest is taking place the last week of January. The week before Devfest will be filled with two kinds of events: **evangelizing discussions** and **fill-in-the-blank work sessions**. (Names subject to change)

**Evangelizing discussions:** These talks involve no coding. They are more focused on promoting the design and philosophy of a technique as opposed to the implementation details. That said, they are often quite practical. Some good talks of this form might be "10 things I learned from 10 years of React development" or "A job whale done: How Docker can streamline your environment setup and simplify your deployment."

**Fill-in-the-blank work session:** Our fill-in-the-blank projects are just like homework assignments where the instructor has already completed the scaffolding for you and your job is to fill in the missing sections of code. For our hackathon bootcamp, we will create one of these fill-in-the-blank projects, which will have modules teaching you all the important skills -- frontend, backend, databases, design, etc. Along with the scaffolding you're given some unit tests. Once you pass all the unit tests, you'll get to see satisfying green checkmarks and have a working program! 

During the Devfest week, we will conquer a room for 2 hours a day and use it for working through the fill-in-the-blank projects. We will have experienced hackers around the room to help with technical issues (or just to chat!).  The modules of this sample app will be relatively independent, so that you can choose your own adventure and add new features as you please. 

Think of the sample project as an adult coloring book, except we are coding instead of coloring.

Some people might take their bootcamp project, add a new feature, and submit it for the hackathon. This is great! That means they've learned the skills they need to work on a hackathon-style project and are one step closer to bringing their future dreams to life. 

## Project Timeline

Making a gamified coding coloring book is a substantial project. Here's a rough timeline:

- September 20: decide on a sample app as the overarching project
- September-October: finish an initial version of the app. Convert a single module into fill-in-the-blank format, complete with unit tests and tutorials. Beta test the single module.
- October-November: Split into small teams to convert more modules, using the initial one as a template. 
- November-December: Add gamification (pretty colors! much wow!) and make improvements to the existing modules.

We probably want a team of 5-7 people to do this, each spending ~3-5 hrs a week on average. We should sync for 15 minutes once a week to make sure everyone is on track. 

For specific tasks, we will be using the following Jira board: [JIRA LINK WILL GO HERE]

Let's go make some coloring books!
